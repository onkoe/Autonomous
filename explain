calc_bearing function: Calulates the `true bearing` for the rover

- true bearing is the bearing from North

bearing_to: This calculates the `relative bearing` between the rover and a coordinate

- This would be the difference between the rover's tru bearing and the coords true bearing
- relative bearing is the bearing between any two objects

gps_controller we need calc_bearing

navigation we need bearing_to
